******************************************************
#### Using the AI (Copilot / Devin / Lmsys) to  create some funning applications through Python coding :
1. A digital GUI SmartClock without alarm
2. Improved the SmartClock with alarm
3. Next considersations :
i. can we pack the smartclockalarm.py into an application that can running in Linux or Windows? 
ii. can we integrate the smartclockalarm.py code into a webpage that can read by the browser Firefox or Chrome?

By using the above AIs, which one (Copilot, Devin, Lmsys or other AIs) is the best?
